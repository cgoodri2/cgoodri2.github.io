It is rare to have the opportunity to work on an individual project. While collaborative research has distinct rewards, so too does individual work. The DREAM process has certainly increase my confidence in my DS skills as well as my decision making. 

Performing each step in the DS pipeline has impressed upon me the cyclical nature of the work. Refining models involved returning to data cleaning & feature engineering, data cleaning & feature engineering necessitated consideration of models, model results required additional domain explorations, domain explorations posed considerations for model results. No one step in the data science pipeline can be completed in isolation. 
The pipeline could perhaps be reframed as an ecological network - each step consumed/consumed by/fueling/fueled by each other step. " A network is defined by a set of elements connected by links between some of the elements. An ecological network is a network in which the elements are often species, and the links represent ecological interactions." (1) I found through the extended process the DREAM experience allowed, I was able to refine both the work and my own skillset more iteratively. I also began to think of the pursuit of a PhD as less of a linear pipeline and more a network - each experience I gain outside traditional pathways would inevitably fuel the quality of my work. 

Currently - I am actively looking for a job in a research institution (be it a university, laboratory or hospital). While the pursuit of a PhD remains a far-off goal, on hold (or rather in development) two consideration have become abundantly clear:

1) The traditional pathways to a PhD most likely will continue to best serve traditional students (frankly - primarily white, privileged, probably male, whose family members have already attained some sort of advanced degree).
2) The non-traditional pathways, like an ecological network, will not be a straight line. Nontraditional students will be fueled by the experiences off the pathway - the developments of alternative skillsets which cannot be obtained following the traditional road.
   
There is both discomfort and comfort in this. Comfort in the knowledge that practical considerations, like the need for financial stability which necessitates a job at this time, will inevitably inform future work. Discomfort in the knowledge that non-traditional pathways are often discounted.

Regardless, I have developed immensely this summer through the DREAM apprenticeship. It has opened the door to a level of higher education that had remained, until this summer, a far-off star.
