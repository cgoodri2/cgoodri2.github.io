title: Week 1 - 3
---

Weeks 1 - 3 were primarily aimed at understanding the structure/shape of the dataset as well as complete a comprehensive literature review and forming of initial research question(s). 

The dataset is comprised of a number of seperate CSV files wach containing various surveys. Some surveys were completed at initial enrollment, some are repeated at regular intervals while others are one time surveys offered to the population to explore a particular interest. Participants were assigned a fox insight id and time waas measured through a days elapsed factor indicating the time between surveys with a shifted number. 

A comprehensive literature review was completed to better understand the state of Machine Learning & Parkinson's Disease (PD). The method used were as folows: PubMed and Google Scholar as source, limited to past 5 years and in English, search terms included: 
    * Machine Learning (ML) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
    * Machine Learning and Parkinson’s Prognosis 
    * Machine learning Parkinson’s Progression
    * Big data and Parkinson’s
    * Precision Medicine ML PD
    * Cognitive Disease Progression PD
    * Psychological Progression PD
    * Psychological Parkinson’s ML

Reasearch was organized within 4 main categories: 
    I. Machine Learning and Genetics of PD
    II. Machine Learning and Disease Prognosis/Progression
    III. Predictive Big Data  & Psychological Aspects of PD
    IV. Fox Insight 

Selected results were as follows

  I. Machine Learning and Genetics of PD

  II. Machine Learning and Disease Prognosis/Progression

  IV. Fox Insight

  In sum - 
  Machine Learning has been utilized with the genetic aspects of PD but clinical implications are limited. ML can successfully identify between PD/HC to a high degree of accuracy, and this has been thoroughly explored. 
  The Psychological aspects of PD less explored/understood. Multivariate analysis with balanced datasets are lacking and necessary. 

  Possible research avenues to explore in the coming weeks include -
      I. Psychological and sociological aspects of Parkinson’s 
      II. Social-Emotional Toll of Disease Progression – Time Series Analysis
      III. Indicators of decline – physiological predictors of advanced disease progression
