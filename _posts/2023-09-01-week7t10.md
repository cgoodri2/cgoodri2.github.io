title: Week 7 - 10
---

Weeks 7 - 10 were focused on iteratively refining models, visualizations, additional domain research & completing a technical report. The abstract for the technical report will be included in a seperate post. 

Model Refinement: 
Corrections included removal of duplicate dummy variables. Prior both the negative and positive affirmation of a disease/response had been maintained. Now, only the positive affirmation of a disease or responses was maintained. Additional methods like weighting were trialed in order to improve recall and precision for 6+ Likert response without success. PCA was explored with >50 components required to capture 80% variance within the dataset. As such, PCA was set aside for future work outside the scope of this project. Survey responses were limited to 365 days from Stress Survey response through filtering. All changes resulted in marginally higher model accuracies. 

Visualizations:
A panel plot of the initial five predictors for each model was made. The decision tree for individuals with PD was also refined. A venn diagram with feature themes was also developed for the conclusion portion of the technical report. Tables with included surveys, model results and LR coefficients were completed.

Additional Research:

Additional research was completed with regards to stress and PD. Environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors are known to influence disease onset, diagnosis, progression, and severity (1 - 3). PD is often associated with motor symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor (4). Individuals with PD also experience debilitating non-motor symptoms including depression, sleeping problems and cognitive impairment (ibid,).  The disease is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons. While the complexities of the molecular mechanisms are still being researched it can be understood that the pathophysiology of PD puts individuals with PD at increased risk of chronic stress, anxiety, and depression (5, 6 - 9). Further, stress may worsen the symptoms of the disease and potentially lessen the effectiveness of PD treatment (5, 10 - 14).

In prior work exploring stress and mindfulness in Parkinson’s disease, van der Heide A et.al wrote, “It remains unclear which factors are associated with experienced stress, which PD symptoms are especially sensitive to stress, what patients do themselves to reduce stress, and what effect these strategies have.” These authors developed the role of stress survey to assess stress & mindfulness within the Fox Insight cohort. Their findings indicated individuals with PD experience higher stress then their HC counter parts, and all PD symptoms were worsened by stress (5). These findings are in accordance with prior studies (ibid,). Questions from the authors mindfulness survey from the perceived stress scale (PSS) and exercise were used within this analysis.
