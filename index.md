## About Me

Author - Corissa Goodrich

Hello! My name is Corissa Goodrich and I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Science with a concentration in computational methods at DePaul University Chicago (anticipated Fall 2023). Having worked in public health, clinical research and clinic management for years, I made the transtion to data science with a particular interest in precision medicine/advanced analytics and machine learning. I believe data science will be instrumental in creating a more just, equitable and effective healthcare system. Data science can provide novel and purposeful insight into the care of patients to enable individuals to live their healthiest lives.

## About My Project

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is progressive neurodegenerative disorder with both motor and nonmotor symptoms (1). As the second most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, a deeper understanding 
of PD’s complex prognostication, progression and impacts remains imperative (2). This research project intends to utilize advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to develop novel insight within the 
field. The process will include a literature review, data cleaning/mangling, exploratory analysis, advanced analytics and completion of an academic paper for publication.

## About the Dataset
The Fox Insight dataset contains demographic information, non-motor, and motor assessments, as well as quality of life/lifestyle questionnaires for national participants. Target enrollment is for 125,000 
individuals and information is obtained following informed consent through regularly administered online surveys. Data collected is aggregated as a single table comma separated value file. Further 
information regarding the data source can be found via ([https://www.foxden.michaeljfox.org.])
